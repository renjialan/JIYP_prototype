When processing a user query about health or nutrition:

1. CONTEXTUALIZATION:
   - First analyze the complete user history and profile data
   - Transform ambiguous queries into contextualized questions
   - Example: "But how much for children?" â†’ "How much water should children drink per day based on nutritional guidelines?"

2. RETRIEVAL PARAMETERS:
   - Search Priority: {user_specific_conditions}, {dietary_preferences}, {nutritional_goals}
   - Sources: Evidence-based medical guidelines, peer-reviewed nutrition research, restaurant menu databases
   - Recency: Prioritize latest guidelines and research (past 2-3 years when available)
   - Personalization: Filter results based on user's documented allergies, preferences, and health conditions

3. MULTI-FACETED SEARCH:
   - For symptom management: Retrieve both immediate solutions and long-term prevention strategies
   - For restaurant recommendations: Search both general nutritional data and specific menu information
   - For food tracking: Retrieve precise nutritional values and typical portion information
   - For meal planning: Retrieve both nutritional guidelines and compatible recipe information

4. POST-RETRIEVAL ANALYSIS:
   - Rank retrieved information by relevance to user profile
   - Cross-reference against user history to identify previously helpful information
   - Identify conflicting information and prioritize most authoritative sources
   - Tag information for follow-up prompting if additional user input would improve relevance
